# Neovim Configuration

**NOTE:** This is for AstroNvim v5+

This is my personal Neovim configuration built on top of [AstroNvim](https://github.com/AstroNvim/AstroNvim), a feature-rich and aesthetic Neovim configuration framework.

## Prerequisites

- Neovim >= 0.9.5
- Git
- A Nerd Font (optional, but recommended for icons)
- ripgrep (for Telescope fuzzy finding)
- lazygit (optional, for git integration via toggleterm)
- Node.js (for some LSP servers)
- Python 3 (for some plugins)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

#### Make a backup of your current nvim and shared folder

```shell
mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.bak
mv ~/.local/share/nvim ~/.local/share/nvim.bak
mv ~/.local/state/nvim ~/.local/state/nvim.bak
mv ~/.cache/nvim ~/.cache/nvim.bak
```

#### Clone the repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/stonecharioteer/nvim-config ~/.config/nvim
```

#### Start Neovim

```shell
nvim
```

AstroNvim will automatically install all plugins on first launch. This may take a few minutes.

## ‚ú® Features

This configuration includes:

- **Language Server Protocol (LSP)**: Configured for Ruby development with ruby-lsp
- **Mason**: Tool installer for LSP servers, linters, and formatters
- **Toggleterm**: Terminal integration with custom terminals for:
  - Lazygit (git TUI)
  - Python REPL
  - Node REPL
  - Htop
- **Custom keybindings**: See the plugin configurations for details

## üîß Key Customizations

- Ruby LSP configured to use mise-managed ruby-lsp installation
- Mason configured to exclude ruby_lsp from auto-installation
- Rubocop LSP disabled (ruby-lsp handles linting)
- Toggleterm with floating terminal as default

## üíª Development Tools

The configuration is optimized for Ruby development but supports multiple languages through Mason's LSP installer.
